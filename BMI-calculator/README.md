Body-mass index is a score used by healthcare practitioners to assess what the ratio of your height is to your weight. The formula for calculating that is:

weight (in kg) / height x height (in m)

Depending on the index, you can be either underweight, normal weight, or overweight. This calculation is simple enough, and is often a fun assignment to start with when learning new programming languages. 

In this assignment, you have to implement a function called bmi_calculator that takes in two arguments - height (in meters), and weight (in kgs). 

After you implement the function, you will have to declare a variable called "result", and save the output of the function inside it.
